strings.Builder appears to be the fastest way and convinient way of concatenating strings. Compared to using the + operator or the strings.Join() function, it usually runs 1.5-3 times faster. For smaller arrays of strings with, let's say, under 5 elements, fmt.Sprintf() might also be a good choice - it has the same speed as the Builder and it's very easy to use. However, when there are more strings to concatenate, it becomes inconvinient.
