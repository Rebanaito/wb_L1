The program will output the slice twice (or rather, two different slices), first looking like this:
b b a
And the other second one looking like this:
a a

This is, again, due to not passing a reference to the slice to the function and simply copying the slice.
Any changes made to the copy are only accessible within the scope of the function, while the original
slice stays unchanged. This time the values [0] and [1] of the underlying array stayed unchanged because
withing the function we first used append(), which in our case would result in memory reallocation,
creating new array for the local slice.
