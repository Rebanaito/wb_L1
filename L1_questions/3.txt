RWMutex allows us to have concurrent read operations. Regular Mutex locks work the same way for both reading and writing, meaning that we can only have one read or one write operation at the moment, while with RWMutex we can have multiple threads reading at the same time, waiting only for a write lock. This can save time in a program where data is stored rarely and that is read often (much more read operations compared to writes). However, when these numbers are closer to each other, regular Mutex might prove not only easier to manage, but also more resource-efficient.
