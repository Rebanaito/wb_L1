This program will output the slice of length 5, where the first element is 100 and others are left with inital values.
The problem here is that the slice is being passed to the someAction() function by value, not referenced.
The underlying int8 array is referenced by a pointer withing the slice, so we are able to change the value of the [0] element.
However, since someAction() gets only a copy of the slice, any changes to the slice itself such as appending values to it
only happen locally, withing the scope of the function. To amend that, we would have to pass the address of the slice, dereferencing the pointer
each time we want to append something to it.
